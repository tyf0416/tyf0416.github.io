Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Mechatronic Systems Engineering at Simon Fraser University, where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Gary Wamg](https://www.sfu.ca/~gwa5/index.html). I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the School of Aerospace at Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Teng Long](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uvgJaUoAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on artificial intelligence for complex engineering systems, aiming to improve their performance, sustainability, and robustness. The goal is to develop generalizable, computationally efficient, and physics-informed methods for:
  - process modeling
  - engineering optimization
  - real-time monitoring
  - intelligent decision-making
with applications in aerospace, additive manufacturing, and large-scale transportation systems.
