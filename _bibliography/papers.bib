  abstract = {To further reduce the computational expense of metamodel-based design optimization (MBDO), a novel sequential radial basis function (RBF)-based optimization method using virtual sample generation (SRBF-VSG) is proposed. Different from the conventional MBDO methods with pure expensive samples, SRBF-VSG employs the virtual sample generation mechanism to improve the optimization efficiency. In the proposed method, a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier is trained based on expensive real samples considering the objective and constraint violation. The classifier is used to determine virtual points without evaluating any expensive simulations. The virtual samples are then generated by combining these virtual points and their Kriging responses. Expensive real samples and cheap virtual samples are used to refine the objective RBF metamodel for efficient space exploration. Several numerical benchmarks are tested to demonstrate the optimization capability of SRBF-VSG. The comparison results indicate that SRBF-VSG generally outperforms the competitive MBDO methods in terms of global convergence, efficiency, and robustness, which illustrates the effectiveness of virtual sample generation. Finally, SRBF-VSG is applied to an airfoil aerodynamic optimization problem and a small Earth observation satellite multidisciplinary design optimization problem to demonstrate its practicality for solving real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract = {Digital twin (DT) refers to any model that reflects a physical system and remains updated with the real-time data from the physical system. Recently, DT constructed with a reduced-order model (DT-ROM) has been applied to aerodynamics and structure health monitoring tasks, whose partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to design the online update formula for reduced bases and coefficients in DT-ROM. Although such online update methods improve the performance of DT-ROM, they are not applicable when the PDEs of a system are unknown. This paper focuses on the online update task where a system is modeled with a DT-ROM, but the system’s PDEs are unknown. To tackle the task, an online sequential update method is proposed. During the update process, the projection residual of online data on the reduced bases is applied to determine whether to update the reduced bases in ROM, and the prediction residual of online data obtained by the offline DT-ROM is adopted to infer whether to update the coefficient models. By checking both criteria sequentially, the online update method selects the necessary online data for the DT update. Three numerical problems and one engineering problem are designed to test the proposed online update method. Testing results demonstrate that (a) the proposed online update method reduces both the projection and prediction residuals gradually, and (b) the performance of the offline DT-ROM model on the testing data is improved gradually during the online update process. Both indicate that the proposed method could be applied to online DT update tasks where the PDEs of the system are unknown.},

  abstract = {Laser wire directed energy deposition (DED-LB/w) offers notable efficiency in metal additive manufacturing (AM), allowing rapid component fabrication with high material utilization. Despite its advantages, challenges such as anisotropy and uneven mechanical properties arise from unregulated heat application, highlighting the need for precise temperature control during deposition. This study evaluates the use of visible light images to predict melt pool temperature, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). While CNN is trained directly on images, GPR and ANN utilize extracted features such as melt pool dimensions. The CNN model notably excels, achieving an R-squared value of 0.981, root mean square error of 44.46, and mean absolute percentage error of 2.74\%, demonstrating the superior capability of visible light imaging in accurately predicting the melt pool temperature. This success illustrates the considerable potential of integrating predictive models with visible light imaging as a cost-effective alternative to traditional sensory systems. Such integration not only offers a pragmatic solution to the high costs and complexities associated with thermal imaging but also opens new avenues for combining other measurement techniques such as pyrometers to further enhance the prediction accuracy for AM process control. Future efforts will concentrate on implementing these models in real-time metal printing, aiming to enhance microstructure control and advance process automation.},

  abstract = {Thermal history has a great effect on the part properties in metal additive manufacturing such as tensile strength and hardness. To study and control the thermal behavior of the AM processes, various data-driven thermal history modeling methods have been developed and tested on simulation data. However, their in-situ application scenarios are rarely explored and discussed. This paper aims to provide a layer-to-layer thermal history prediction model, which enables predicting the thermal history of a yet-to-print layer based on the data measured from the printed lower layers. First, the thermal behavior is analyzed to reveal the similarities in temperature curves of two successive layers. Then four input variables are identified, including the deposition rate, the relative height of the layer, the printing time, and the dwell time of one layer. Based on the selected input variables and the temperature output, a fully connected neural network with residual connection is designed to simplify the training process. Five numerical simulations are designed to collect temperature curves (curve segments of a temperature profile) on each layer, and one experimental study on wire arc additive manufacturing is completed to record the temperature curves. Based on the collected data, three cases are proposed to test the modeling framework, such as (a) dividing all simulation data into the training set and validation set, (b) training the model based on four simulation runs and its validation with the last simulation, and (c) training the model with all simulation data and testing on the experimental data. The former two cases show great prediction accuracies with a relative error of less than 5\% in most cases, which indicates its potential in online prediction when trained with data from the same input conditions or same systems. While the applicability of the model trained only with simulation data should be explored further in real experiments.},

  abstract = {Cold metal transfer wire and arc additive manufacturing (CMT-WAAM) is a type of metal additive manufacturing technology that has attracted attention in recent years due to its ability to print walls with less dimensional inaccuracies than regular WAAM. To print near net shape parts by CMT-WAAM, there is a need to define a set of height-related geometrical parameters (HGPs) that can capture, quantify, and compare the quality of the height of the produced parts. In this study, a set of HGPs, namely, the average height error (AHE), maximum height variation (MHV), and average absolute slope (AAS) are defined and assessed. Fifteen single-track multi-layer walls are printed to check the effect of process parameters on the defined HGPs. It is found that the stability of the print cannot be guaranteed by checking the visual appearance of the single beads and at least five-to-ten-layer walls should be printed to check the quality and stability of the print. It is also found that the travel speed (TS) and wire feed speed (WFS) have positive monotonic relationships with AAS and MHV, respectively. Correlations between process parameters and HGPs are modeled and validation tests are performed to check the validity of the developed models. The defined three HGPs are shown to be able to quantify, capture, and compare the quality of a height of a wall and can be used for other similar applications.},

  abstract = {The process-structure-property modeling of additive manufacturing (AM) products plays an important role in process and quality control. In practice however, only limited data are available for each product due to its expensive material and time-consuming fabricating process, which becomes an obstacle to achieve high quality models. Transfer learning (TL) is a new and promising approach that the model of one product (source) may be reused for another product (target) with limited new data on the target. This paper focuses on reviewing applications of TL in AM modeling in order to help further research in this area. To clarify the specific topic, the problem definition is presented, as well as the differences between TL, multi-fidelity modeling, and multi-task learning. Then current applications of TL in AM modeling are summarized according to different TL approaches. To better understand the performances of different TL approaches, several representative TL-assisted AM modeling methods are reproduced and tested on an open-source dataset. Based on the test results, their effectiveness and limitations are discussed in detail. Finally, future research directions about TL in AM modeling are discussed in hope to explore more potential of TL in boosting the AM model performance.},

  abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has recently attracted attention due to its potential for batch/mass production of metal parts. This process, however, currently suffers from problems including low productivity, inconsistency in the properties of the printed parts, and defects such as lack of fusion, keyholing, and un-melted powders. Finite Element (FE) modeling cannot accurately model the metal AM process and has a high computational cost. Empirical models based on experiments are time-consuming and expensive. This paper improves a previously developed framework that takes advantages of both empirical and FE models. The validity and accuracy of the metamodel developed in the previous framework depend on the initial assumption of parameter uncertainties. This causes a problem when the assumed uncertainties are far from the actual values. The proposed framework introduces an iterative calibration process to overcome this limitation. In addition, the u\_pooling metric used as the calibration metric in the previous framework is found not as good as the second-order statistical moment-based metric (SMM), after comparing several calibration metrics. The proposed framework is then applied to a four-variable porosity modeling problem. The obtained model is more accurate than using other approaches with only 10 available experimental data points for calibration and validation.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
